# Introduction
This is the Airbnb dataset which describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NC for the year 2019. From 2008,guests and hosts thst have used the Airbnb platform to expand on travelling possibilities and present more unique and personalized way of experienceing the world. This project outlines the data cleaning process on Airbnb dataset in order to improve its quality and prepare it for further analysis.

# Objectives
* Clean the dataset to ensure data integrity
* Fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate or incomplete data within the dataset

## Data Cleanning
As it is well known that data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate or incomplete data within the data withing a particular dataset. It is the significant of data analysis, our main aims and objectives of this project is to properly clean the dataset.

## Initial Data Inspection:
 * Data Types: Assessed the data types of each column to identify and correct inconsistencies.
 * Missing Values: Identified and quantified missing values in each column.
 * Duplicate Records: Identified and removed duplicate records.

## Data Cleaning Steps:
   * Handling Missing Values: NaN were changed to empty column
   * Deletion: Removed duplicate rows.

## Data Formatting and Standardization:
   * Consistent Formatting: Ensured consistent formatting for dates, times, and currencies.
   * Standardization: Converted text data to a standardized format (e.g., lowercase, uppercase, or title case).
## Duplicate Removal:
   * Identification: Used appropriate techniques (e.g., duplicated() method) to identify duplicate records.
   * Removal: Removed duplicate records to avoid data redundancy.
## Post-Cleaning Data Assessment:
 * Data Quality: Verified the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the cleaned data.
 * Data Integrity: Ensured the structural integrity of the dataset, including data types and relationships between variables.
 * Data Validity: Checked for logical and domain-specific constraints.
## Conclusion
The data cleaning process significantly improved the quality of the NYC Airbnb dataset by addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, and duplicates. The cleaned dataset is now ready for further analysis and modeling.
